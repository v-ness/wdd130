    <img alt="Me with my doll designs" src="images/encantodolls.jpg" style="width:320px;height:445px;">
    <h2>My name is Vanessa</h2>
    <p>I am married with three young children, ages 7, 5 and 18 months. The youngest is our only girl. I will be celebrating my 10 year anniversary next month. </p>
    <p>I turned my love for crochet into a business about 2 years ago, so I design crochet doll patterns.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church since 2004. My whole family joined when I was a teenager, but only two of us remain active now. I see it as a big responsibility to carry the torch of faith to the next generation.</p>
    <p>I love that BYU-Idaho so closely connects the Gospel and the Lord Jesus Christ with everything we are learning. I believe as we involve the Lord in our learning He can help us achieve what we alone could not.</p>
