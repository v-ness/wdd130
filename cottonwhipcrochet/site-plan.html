        My paid crochet patterns can be found on etsy at cottonwhipcrochet.etsy.com. The reason you will enjoy these patterns is they go into detail to help you achieve a similar result to my finished item. I specify the exact yarns used along with their color codes, and I provide plenty of photos in the pattern itself along with links to video tutorials.

        While I do not recommend these patterns for beginners, they are great for crocheters who know the basics of crochet like the single crochet (sc), the half double crochet (hdc) and the double crochet (dc). If you have made a few amigurumi in the past you will be able to follow along with these patterns. 

        You can see some of my premium patterns here:

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I started learning to crochet in 2013. My first project was a baby blanket, then I made an amigurumi turtle. I continued crocheting from then and learning new skills which pattern. In 2020 I was following along with a pattern to make a doll and I found myself making adjustments to certain parts. That is when I thought to myself, “I think I could design my own pattern”. I have been doing so since. 

        After having spent years following other's patterns, I knew what I liked and didn't like. I loved detailed patterns that told me the exact yarns used, not just a category weight. I liked when they were well structured and easy to read. I loved it when they had photos or videos for the more complicated parts. All of these experiences lead me to polish my patterns to what they are currently. 

        I'm always looking to improve and to grow as a crochet pattern designer. I hope you enjoy my patterns!
