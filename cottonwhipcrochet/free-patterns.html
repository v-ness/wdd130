        Eyes
        Attach your safety eyes now at R4 as shown. This will create a space of 8 rounds between each eye.

        Nose

        With pink embroidery thread, sew nose back and forth as follows, making your thread shorter in length as you move to the bottom.

        Now sew over the strands you made in a vertical direction. Start on the right as shown then go to the opposite end and work your way to the first vertical line you made.

        With dark brown embroidery thread sew mouth as shown.
        The vertical line coming down from the nose should be about one round long
        To find how long to make the smile, look to the farthest point of the nose on the right side and extend the smile that same length. Repeat for the left side.
